TODO:
Add getaddrinfo implementation so this works on multi machine
    Right now several "127.0.0.1"s are hardcoded for testing
Put some mutexes in place for thread safety
LIST all users, does not get synchronized
client_db should really be map
    would affect find_user, populate following, others...
